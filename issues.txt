allowances should include those granted to the user and by the user (requirements fail, not possible to get the granted by without a granted to)

balances don't show the quantity or the token image, etc. Use FetchBalancesWithMetadata endpoint rather than FetchBalances endpoint.

Attempts to use the original CreateTokenClass flow rather than the new NFTCollection flow
    /api/asset/token-contract/GrantNftCollectionAuthorization - user claims a collection name
    /api/asset/token-contract/CreateNftCollection - user creates an NFT token class based on a claimed collection name
    /api/asset/token-contract/FetchNftCollectionAuthorizationsWithPagination - get the user's claimed collections
