# GalaChain Command Center - Progress Log

## Learnings Section
(Patterns discovered, gotchas encountered, useful context for future iterations)
- NestJS project structure: src/ for backend, client/ for Vue, shared/ for types
- Use @nestjs/serve-static to serve Vue build from dist/client
- TypeScript paths configured for @shared/* imports
- nest-cli.json required for nest build command
- path-to-regexp v8+ syntax: use '/api{/*path}' not '/api/(.*)'
- Use SpaFallbackController with @Get('*path') for SPA fallback since ServeStaticModule doesn't handle it
- __dirname resolves to src/ in dev and dist/src/ in production - use relative paths accordingly
- vue-tsc with noUnusedLocals treats type imports as unused when used in interfaces - re-export to fix
- Use `export type { }` for type-only re-exports with isolatedModules: true
- @gala-chain/api UserAlias and UserRef are branded types (string & { __marker__: void })

## Iteration 3 - nestjs-static-serving
- What was implemented:
  - Configured ServeStaticModule in app.module.ts to serve Vue build from dist/client
  - Created SpaFallbackController with wildcard route for SPA fallback
  - Fixed exclude pattern for new path-to-regexp syntax: '/api{/*path}'
  - Created AppController with health endpoint at GET /api/health
  - Set up Jest with ts-jest for server tests
  - Created unit tests for AppController
  - Created integration tests for static serving (spawns actual server process)
- Files changed:
  - src/app.module.ts (updated)
  - src/app.controller.ts (new)
  - src/spa-fallback.controller.ts (new)
  - src/__tests__/app.controller.spec.ts (new)

  - jest.config.js (new)
  - package.json (added Jest dependencies)
- GalaChain tools used: None (infrastructure setup)
- Tests: All 8 tests pass (3 unit, 1 e2e, 4 integration)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - path-to-regexp v8+ syntax changed: use '/api{/*path}' instead of '/api/(.*)'
  - __dirname in NestJS changes between dev (src/) and production (dist/src/)
  - Use join(__dirname, '..', 'client') to resolve correctly in both contexts
  - ServeStaticModule doesn't have built-in SPA fallback - use a wildcard controller
  - Integration tests can spawn the actual server to test production behavior
  - Jest forceExit: true helps with child process cleanup
---

## Iteration 4 - environment-configuration
- What was implemented:
  - Created .env file at project root for NestJS with PORT, GALACHAIN_ENV, GALACHAIN_GATEWAY_URL, GALACHAIN_API_URL
  - Created .env.example documenting all variables for both server and client
  - Updated client/.env with VITE_GALACHAIN_ENV, VITE_GALACHAIN_GATEWAY_URL, VITE_GALACHAIN_API_URL
  - Created src/config/configuration.ts with typed AppConfiguration and validation
  - Updated app.module.ts to use ConfigModule.forRoot with load: [configuration]
  - Updated client/src/lib/config.ts with GalaChainConfig type and environment-based defaults
  - Created src/__tests__/configuration.spec.ts with comprehensive validation tests
  - Created client/vitest.config.ts and client/__tests__/config.spec.ts for client config tests
  - Added jsdom to client devDependencies for Vitest
  - Updated jest.config.js to exclude client/ tests (run by Vitest instead)
- Files changed:

  - client/package.json (added jsdom)
  - jest.config.js (updated)
- GalaChain tools used: None (configuration setup)
- Tests: 37 total tests pass (25 server + 12 client)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - NestJS ConfigModule.forRoot accepts load: [configFn] for custom configuration factories
  - Vitest needs jsdom for DOM environment in tests
  - Jest testRegex should include path prefix (src/) to avoid running client tests
  - Client config uses import.meta.env for Vite environment variables
  - Environment defaults should be based on GALACHAIN_ENV (production vs stage)

  - shared/types/wallet.ts (updated)
  - shared/types/display.ts (new)
  - shared/index.ts (updated)
  - client/tsconfig.json (updated - added @shared/* path and ../shared/**/*.ts to include)
  - client/vite.config.ts (updated - added @shared alias)
  - package.json (updated - added @gala-chain/api dependency)
- GalaChain tools used: None (used direct inspection of @gala-chain/api type definitions)
- Tests: All 37 tests pass (12 client + 25 server)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - vue-tsc with noUnusedLocals: true treats type-only imports as unused even when used in interfaces
  - Workaround: Re-export the imported types to mark them as "used"
  - Use `export type { }` for type-only re-exports with isolatedModules: true
  - UserAlias and UserRef are branded types (string & { __marker__: void })
